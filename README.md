## Card Images
All of the playing card images except for the back of the cards are taken from Byron Knoll's [Vector Playing Cards](http://byronknoll.blogspot.com/2011/03/vector-playing-cards.html), which were released to the public domain.

The image of the back side of the card is from [Vector Cards](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vector-cards/) used under the LGPL.
